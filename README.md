Background: Who are ACICIS Study Indonesia The Australian Consortium for In-Country Indonesian Studies (ACICIS pronounced Ah-chee-chis, as an Indonesian would say it) is a non-profit international educational consortium of 17 Australia universities. The secretariat is housed at UWA, next to Hackett caf. We facilitate study abroad programs in Indonesia for predominantly Australian undergraduate students. These study abroad programs include short-term options (2,3 or 6 week programs) and semester long programs. Our programs are in a range of disciplines including Indonesian language, journalism, development, business, law, creative arts, agriculture, sustainable tourism and international relations. We were established in 1995 and since then have sent around 3,700 students to Indonesia. Students can typically do our programs for academic credit and receive a New Colombo Plan mobility grant (if eligible) to support them in the program.
